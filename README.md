The f*cking pprog game.

## plot proposal
Our game will be turn-based and will be set on an hexagonal grid. Your task
will be to survive as long as possible, enduring natural disasters, shortage of
resources, etc. At first, you will begin with a minimal amount of resources and
you will need to build, mine and cultivate to be able to survive to the next
round. The game ends when you run out of essential resources. In addition, we
plan on adding attack functionality with a mini game. When you choose to attack
or are attacked from an adjacent cell, the mini game will run and you will be
more or less prepared to play it depending on your available resources. Also,
the game theme is not final, and we are thinking of a more exciting topic for
our story, although the game dynamics will remain the same.
