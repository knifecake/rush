 *
 *  - const char *error_msg
 *  - cont char *function_name
 *  - const char *file_name
 *  - int line_number

 * file_name and line_number can be automatically obtained thanks to the

 * arguments, e.g. handle_error("some error message", "load_resources",
 * __FILE__, __LINE__); Do not explicitly state neither of the previous, as
 * they may change over time.
