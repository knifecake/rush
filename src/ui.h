/*
 * UI Module
 *
 * This module contains helper functions to draw different things on screen, if
 * on GUI-mode, or represent them through text, if on text mode.
 *
 * Functions on this module should be game-engine agnostic. Preferrably, they
 * should only depend on the sprite, terminal and font libraries.
 *
 * Each of the functions defined here should take care of drawing just a tiny
 * part of the UI, and possible receive some user input in case the UI
 * component is interactive, such as with a list.
